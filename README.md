# TypingTestGame
I have programmed simple words per minute (WPM) typing test game that I created on C++. A user gets to choose the given quote, which is Suess
and Tolk.The quote will pop up immediately after a user chooses the quote and he/she will begin typing. A user will type 1 and enter once he/she
finishes up typing the quote. The program outputs number of words that a user misspelled, total time that a user took to finisht the quote, and
a user's WPM.
